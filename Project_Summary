The goal of this project is to propose a new approach to (1) analyze sensor data faster, (2) extract additional information from data such as sensor damage. This project was done in python using the library sciKit-learn. The approach was developed using experimental data acquired during my Ph.D. corresponding to an experiment in which a fiber-optic sensor was used to differentiate between water and CO2.
I have explored an approach based on the combination of a regression and a classification algorithm. The regression algorithm is the simple linear regression and was used to infer sensor performance. The basic idea is to train the regression fit using initial data with the assumption that the sensor is pristine and thus, working in optimum conditions. After that, the fit is applied to test data and the coefficient of determination (r2) is compared with r2 of the initial data. The decrease of r2 for each cycle in which the sensor is exposed to water or CO2 is an indication that the sensor is contaminated or damaged. The classifier is the K-Nearest Neighbor and is used to identify the exposed solution (water or CO2) based on the experimental data.
The approach was applied to a low-quality dataset in which the sensor was damaged and a high-quality dataset in which the sensor was working at best performance during the whole experiment. Each dataset has approximately 12 000 points and the skewness is -0.03 for the high-quality dataset and -0.4 for the low-quality dataset.
The results for the regression show that the r2 is close to 1 for both train and test set in the high-quality dataset. For the low-quality dataset, r2 is 0.9992 for the test set and 0.2199 for the train set. This shows that r2 can be used to infer data quality. The results obtained with the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier show that the algorithm predicts the correct solution even in the low-quality dataset.
